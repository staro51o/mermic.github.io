# The Software: PyTorch, fastai, and Jupyter

(And Why It Doesn't Matter)

## PyTorch and fastai

PyTorch works best as a low-level foundation library, providing the basic operations for higher-level functionality. The fastai library is the most popular library for adding this higher-level functionality on top of PyTorch.By the end of [the book](https://course.fast.ai/Resources/book.html), you'll understand nearly all the code that's inside fastai (and much of PyTorch too), because in each chapter we'll be digging a level deeper to show you exactly what's going on as we build and train our models. This means that you'll have learned the most important best practices used in modern deep learningâ€”not just howto use them, but how they really work and are implemented. If you want to use those approaches in another framework, you'll have the knowledge you need to do so if needed. 

## Jupyter
Since the most important thing for learning deep learning is writing code and experimenting, it's important that you have a great platform for experimenting with code. The most popular programming experimentation platform is called Jupyter. This is what we will be using throughout this blog.

## Right Now

Let's see it in practice and train our first model.
